  ## Design Idea & Approach


### Architecture
<p align="center">
    <img src="Screenshots/flowchart.PrescriptA.jpg" alt="Architecture"  width="600" height="450">
</p>

- The frontend is built with **Streamlit** for a simple UI, while the backend leverages **Python, OCR (pdf2image, PIL), and Gemini AI (Google API)** for prescription reading and chatbot responses.  
- **Priscripta** extracts **handwritten and electronic prescription details** using **OCR & AI**, ensuring **accurate medication identification**. The system **validates prescriptions** against a **medication database**, preventing **errors and stock issues**.  
- This **AI-driven chatbot**, powered by **Gemini AI**, provides **instant responses** to **pharmacist and patient queries** regarding **dosage, side effects, drug interactions, and medicine instructions**.  
- Initially designed for **limited concurrent users**, the system will scale using **cloud-based AI models, SQL/NoSQL databases, and server load balancing**. Future enhancements include **local AI models for cost efficiency**.

### Sample Prototype (Prescription)

I got a sample prescription from google as mock data since I can't get access to real patient data due to ethical reasons. I used the prescription to test my project's functionality. Below is the data sample I used :

### Project Flow

<p align="center">
    <img src="Screenshots/projectflow.jpg" alt="ML Lifecycle" width="600" height="500">
</p>  

- The **machine learning cycle** in this process starts with a user **uploading a prescription**, which undergoes **file type classification**. If the file is a **PDF**, it is first **converted into an image** before being **encoded in Base64 format**. The system then performs **document type classification** to determine if it is a **valid prescription**. Once classified, **prescription data extraction** is carried out using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to retrieve **relevant medical information**. The **extracted data** is then **analyzed** to generate a **structured medication order**.  

- Next, the **medication order** is matched against a **predefined medication database** to verify **availability and accuracy**. If a **match is found**, the **pharmacy stock is updated accordingly**. The **processed orders** are then **displayed for review**, after which they can be **exported to a CSV file** for **further processing or record-keeping**.  

- In parallel, the system also provides **additional functionalities** such as **handling chat queries** by **responding to user questions** and **setting up medicine reminders**. The **reminders** are **scheduled** and **sent to users via email notifications**, ensuring **adherence to prescribed medication schedules**. Through this **structured pipeline**, the system integrates **machine learning techniques** with **practical healthcare applications**, **streamlining prescription processing and medication management efficiently**.



## Getting Started



### Setting up the ML Model API locally

1. Make sure you have the following installed:
   - Python (version 3.x)
   - pip (Python package installer)
   - Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   - preferred to use lightning ai for faster processing
      
2.  Install Python dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Your Streamlit App
   Navigate to main directory where app.py is located and run:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   

## Use Cases

-  **Automated Prescription Processing** ‚Äì AI reads and extracts details from **handwritten and electronic prescriptions**.  
-  **Pharmacy Inventory Management** ‚Äì Tracks **medicine availability** and prevents **stock shortages**.  
-  **AI Chatbot Assistance** ‚Äì Answers **medicine-related queries** for **pharmacists and patients**.  
-  **Medication Ordering & Billing** ‚Äì Generates **orders and bills** directly from **prescriptions**.  
-  **Patient Medicine Availability Check** ‚Äì Allows users to **check stock** before visiting a **pharmacy**.  
-  **Online Medicine Ordering** ‚Äì Enables **patients** to place **orders** through the **patient interface**.
-  **Automated Medication Reminders** ‚Äì Sends **alerts via MediClock** to improve **patient adherence**. 
-  **Hospital & Clinic Integration** ‚Äì Streamlines **medication management** within **healthcare facilities**.  


### *Social Impact of Priscripta*  

-  **Reduces Prescription Errors** ‚Äì Prevent deaths and healthcare complications due to misinterpretation of Prescription
-  **Improve Medicine Accessibility** ‚Äì Ensures proper management of Database increasing accessibility of Medicines in healthcare sector also enabling patients to check medicine availability and order remotely
-  **Enhances Medication Adherence** ‚Äì Sends automated reminders, helping patients escpecially older patients with lack of personal care to take medicines on time.  
-  **Increases Pharmacy Efficiency** ‚Äì Automates repetitive tasks such as prescription analysis , billing orders and database management allowing pharmacists to focus on patient care. 
-  **Reduces Healthcare Costs** ‚Äì Prevents medication waste and optimizes stock management, lowering expenses.  

## Scopes of Improvement


- **Patient Interface:** Create a separate interface for patients and pharmacists where Pharmacist can keep track of medicine database while patient can check availability of medicines and place orders.
- **User Login:** Create an authentication system for users so that they can store their data always.
- **User Interface:** Create more interactive user interface making it more convinient to use.
- **Mobile App:** Create a mobile app for the same to increase scalability and reach.
